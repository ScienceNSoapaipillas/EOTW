To start, copy `env.example` to `.env`
Be sure to add your personal discord key to the `.env` file

To run and connect to the discord server, run `app.py` and import the bot into your server of choice through the discord web app portal. All commands start with `!sb-`.

Hope this helps with whatever! -Sci
